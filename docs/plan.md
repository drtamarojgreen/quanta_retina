# Strategies for 3D Representation in a 2D Console

This document outlines strategies for representing a 3D graph in a 2D console environment. The goal is to create a sense of depth and perspective using only ASCII characters.

## 1. Simulating Depth with Node Size (Z-axis)

The most straightforward way to simulate a third dimension (depth, or the z-axis) on a 2D plane is to vary the size of the nodes. This is the primary technique used in the QuantaGraph application.

*   **Larger Nodes Appear Closer:** Nodes that are closer to the viewer are rendered as larger objects. For example, a 5x5 block of characters.
*   **Smaller Nodes Appear Farther:** Nodes that are farther away are rendered as smaller objects, such as a single character.
*   **Intermediate Sizes:** Nodes at intermediate depths can be represented by intermediate sizes (e.g., a 3x3 block).

This technique leverages our natural perception of perspective, where objects appear smaller as they get farther away. A wider range of sizes can be used to represent more gradations of depth.

## 2. Occlusion

Occlusion is the effect of one object in a 3D space blocking another object from view. In a 2D console, this can be simulated by drawing objects in a specific order.

*   **Draw Farther Objects First:** The rendering process should start with the objects that are farthest away from the viewer. This is typically done by sorting all objects by their z-coordinate and drawing them in ascending order.
*   **Draw Closer Objects Last:** Objects that are closer to the viewer should be drawn on top of the farther objects.

In the context of a graph, this means:
1.  **Draw Edges First:** The lines representing the connections between nodes should be drawn first.
2.  **Draw Nodes Second:** The nodes should be drawn on top of the edges. This creates the illusion that the nodes are closer to the viewer than the connections, and that the nodes are solid objects that block the view of the lines behind them.

The QuantaGraph application already implements this technique.

## 3. Vanishing Points and Perspective Projection

A more advanced technique for creating a sense of 3D space is to use vanishing points. A vanishing point is a point on the horizon where parallel lines appear to converge. This requires a full 3D representation of the graph, with each node having `(x, y, z)` coordinates.

### Single-Point Perspective

In single-point perspective, all lines that are perpendicular to the viewer's line of sight appear to converge at a single point in the distance.

*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Define a Vanishing Point:** Choose a coordinate on the 2D console grid to act as the vanishing point (e.g., the center of the screen).
    2.  **Project 3D Coordinates to 2D:** To render a 3D point `(x, y, z)` onto the 2D screen, you can use a perspective projection formula. A simple formula could be:
        *   `screen_x = (x * focal_length) / (z + focal_length) + center_x`
        *   `screen_y = (y * focal_length) / (z + focal_length) + center_y`
        Where `focal_length` controls the strength of the perspective effect (field of view), and `(center_x, center_y)` is the vanishing point.
    3.  **Connect the Dots:** After projecting the 3D coordinates of the nodes to 2D screen coordinates, draw the lines (edges) between them. The size of the node on the screen would also be dependent on its `z` coordinate.

### Two-Point and Three-Point Perspective

*   **Two-Point Perspective:** Uses two vanishing points, typically on the horizon line. This is useful for viewing objects at an angle, creating a more dynamic and realistic view.
*   **Three-Point Perspective:** Adds a third vanishing point above or below the horizon. This is used for creating a sense of height, as if the viewer is looking up or down at the graph.

## 4. Advanced Techniques

### Character Choice and Shading

*   **Brightness/Shading:** Use a ramp of characters with different densities to simulate lighting and shading. For example: `'@#%*+=-.'` from brightest to darkest. This can be used to give nodes a rounded or spherical appearance.
*   **Atmospheric Perspective:** Objects that are farther away can be rendered with characters that have less contrast or are "fuzzier" to simulate the effect of the atmosphere. For example, using `.` or `:` for distant nodes.

### Color

If the console supports it, using color can dramatically improve the sense of depth and visual clarity.

*   **Depth Cueing:** Use color to indicate depth. For example, warmer colors (like red or orange) for closer objects and cooler colors (like blue or purple) for farther objects.
*   **Highlighting:** Use color to highlight active nodes or important connections in the graph.

### Animation

Creating a sequence of frames that show the graph rotating or moving can create a powerful 3D illusion, even with simple rendering techniques.

*   **Matrix Transformations:** Use rotation matrices to update the `(x, y, z)` coordinates of each node in the graph for each frame of the animation.
*   **Interpolation:** Smoothly interpolate the positions of nodes between different states of the graph to create fluid animations.

### Dithering

Dithering can be used to create the illusion of more colors or shades of gray than are actually available. By using patterns of different characters, you can create a much richer visual texture.
