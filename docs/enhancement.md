# QuantaGraph Enhancement Suggestions

This document outlines potential enhancements for the QuantaGraph prototype, aiming to increase its interactivity, data handling capabilities, and visual fidelity.

## 1. User Interactivity

Enhancing user control over the graph visualization would significantly improve the application's utility as a demonstration tool.

*   **Graph Rotation:** Implement controls (e.g., arrow keys) to rotate the graph in 3D space. This would require recalculating node positions based on a rotation matrix.
*   **Zoom Functionality:** Allow the user to zoom in and out (e.g., with '+' and '-' keys), which would scale the entire graph and adjust node sizes accordingly.
*   **Node Selection:** Enable a cursor or selection mechanism to highlight a specific node, displaying its ID, connections, or other metadata.
*   **Panning/Translation:** Allow the user to move the camera's viewpoint up, down, left, or right to inspect different areas of a large graph.
*   **Interactive Node Placement:** Allow users to click and drag nodes to new positions to manually adjust the graph layout.

## 2. Graph Data and Loading

The current hardcoded graphs limit the application's scope. Dynamic data loading would make it a more versatile tool.

*   **Load from File:** Implement functionality to load graph structures from external files (e.g., JSON, GML, GraphML, or a simple custom format like an adjacency list).
*   **Procedural Generation:** Add an option to generate random graphs based on user-defined parameters like the number of nodes and edge density.
*   **Directed Graphs:** Extend the rendering logic to support directed graphs, using arrowheads or other visual cues to indicate the direction of edges.
*   **Weighted Edges:** Introduce the concept of edge weights, which could be visualized through varying line thickness or brightness.

## 3. Visual and Rendering Improvements

Improving the visual output would make the 3D representation more convincing and aesthetically pleasing.

*   **Advanced Character Shading:** Use a wider range of ASCII characters (e.g., `.`, `:`, `*`, `#`) to create more detailed shading and a better illusion of depth and lighting.
*   **Node Labeling:** Add text labels to nodes, which would need to be positioned intelligently to avoid overlapping and remain readable during rotation.
*   **Terminal Color Support:** Introduce color using ANSI escape codes to differentiate nodes, highlight selections, or encode additional data.
*   **Improved Occlusion:** Refine the occlusion logic so that edges are properly hidden when they pass behind other, closer nodes, not just at the node's center.
*   **Line-Drawing Characters:** Use box-drawing characters for straighter, cleaner lines instead of `/` and `\`.

## 4. Code and Architectural Enhancements

Refactoring the codebase would improve maintainability, scalability, and portability.

*   **Modular Design:** Separate the graph data structure, physics/layout logic, and rendering into distinct classes or modules.
*   **Build System:** Integrate a build system like CMake or Make to simplify the compilation process and manage dependencies.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Replace the Windows-specific `conio.h` with a cross-platform library (like ncurses) or standard C++ I/O for handling user input, making the application portable to Linux and macOS.
*   **Add Comments:** Improve the code documentation and add comments to explain the rendering and graph logic.

## 5. Physics and Layout

*   **Force-Directed Layout:** Implement a simple physics simulation (e.g., Fruchterman-Reingold) to automatically arrange nodes in a visually logical and pleasing layout. Nodes would repel each other, while edges would pull connected nodes together.
*   **Collision Detection:** Prevent nodes from overlapping visually by implementing collision detection between them.
