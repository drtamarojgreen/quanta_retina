### Category 1: Core Data & Graph Structure

1.  **Explicit Z-axis Coordinate:** Add a `z` coordinate to the `Node` struct instead of just implying it with `size`.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires updating rendering logic to translate the `z` coordinate into node size and potentially other visual cues.
2.  **Weighted Edges:** Add a `weight` attribute to the `Edge` struct for use in visualization.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires a method to visually represent edge weights, such as varying thickness or character density.
3.  **Directed Edges:** Support directed graphs (arrows) in addition to undirected ones.
    *   **Challenge:** Rendering clear, unambiguous arrowheads with ASCII characters is complex.
4.  **Node Subscriptions/Events:** Implement a simple event system where other parts of the code can subscribe to events on a node (e.g., `onSelect`, `onMove`, `onUpdate`).
    *   **Challenge:** Designing a clean and efficient event handling system without introducing excessive overhead or complexity.
5.  **Edge Labels:** Allow edges to have text labels (e.g., for weights).
    *   **Challenge:** Placing labels along edge paths cleanly without cluttering the view.
6.  **Multiple Edge Types:** Support different types of edges with distinct visual styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted).
    *   **Challenge:** Defining and rendering a clear visual language for different edge types using a limited character set.
7.  **Graph Adjacency List:** Switch from an edge vector to an adjacency list for more efficient traversal algorithms.
    *   **Challenge:** Refactoring the graph traversal and rendering logic to work with the new data structure.
8.  **Graph Data Validation:** Add checks to ensure graph data is valid (e.g., edges don't connect non-existent nodes).
    *   **Challenge:** Implementing robust validation without a significant performance penalty during graph loading.
9.  **Floating-Point Coordinates:** Use `float` or `double` for node coordinates to support more precise layout algorithms.
    *   **Challenge:** All floating-point coordinates must be correctly quantized or rounded for rendering on the integer-based console grid.
10. **Node Shape Primitives:** Allow nodes to be rendered as primitive shapes other than squares (e.g., circles, diamonds, triangles).
    *   **Challenge:** Drawing smooth-looking primitive shapes with ASCII characters is difficult.
11. **Graph Deep Copy:** Implement a proper deep copy constructor for the `Graph` class to support state saving for animations.
    *   **Challenge:** Ensuring all dynamically allocated memory is correctly copied without memory leaks.
12. **Spatial Hashing:** Implement a spatial hash or quadtree to speed up rendering and collision detection for very large graphs.
    *   **Challenge:** Adds significant complexity to the data structures; overkill for small graphs.
13. **Node/Edge Metadata:** Allow arbitrary key-value metadata on nodes and edges for use by advanced rendering techniques.
    *   **Challenge:** Designing a flexible data structure for metadata that is still efficient to access.
14. **Object-Oriented Nodes/Edges:** Convert `Node` and `Edge` structs into classes with methods to encapsulate their logic.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires a significant architectural refactor, moving logic from the `GraphRenderer` into these new classes.
15. **Hyperedges:** Support edges that can connect more than two nodes, representing a relationship between a group of nodes.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires a new data structure for edges and a visual language for rendering them (e.g., as a central hub).
16. **Node Clustering:** Programmatically group nodes into clusters with a visual representation (e.g., a boundary drawn around them).
    *   **Challenge:** Developing an algorithm to define clusters and rendering the boundaries without cluttering the graph.
