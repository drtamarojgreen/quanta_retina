# QuantaGraph Enhancement Suggestions (Revised)

This document outlines 100 potential enhancements for the QuantaGraph prototype, revised to focus strictly on the core purpose: demonstrating novel methods for rendering network graphs in a standard terminal console.

---

### Category 1: Core Data & Graph Structure (15)

1.  **Dynamic Canvas Size:** Automatically adjust canvas dimensions based on graph size or terminal window size.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires cross-platform terminal size detection and dynamic memory allocation for the canvas.
2.  **Explicit Z-axis Coordinate:** Add a `z` coordinate to the `Node` struct instead of just implying it with `size`.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires updating rendering logic to translate the `z` coordinate into node size and potentially other visual cues.
3.  **Weighted Edges:** Add a `weight` attribute to the `Edge` struct for use in visualization.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires a method to visually represent edge weights, such as varying thickness or character density.
4.  **Directed Edges:** Support directed graphs (arrows) in addition to undirected ones.
    *   **Challenge:** Rendering clear, unambiguous arrowheads with ASCII characters is complex.
5.  **Node Labels:** Allow nodes to have text labels displayed near them.
    *   **Challenge:** Managing label placement to avoid overlap with other nodes or edges, especially in dense graphs.
6.  **Edge Labels:** Allow edges to have text labels (e.g., for weights).
    *   **Challenge:** Placing labels along edge paths cleanly without cluttering the view.
7.  **Multiple Edge Types:** Support different types of edges with distinct visual styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted).
    *   **Challenge:** Defining and rendering a clear visual language for different edge types using a limited character set.
8.  **Graph Adjacency List:** Switch from an edge vector to an adjacency list for more efficient traversal algorithms.
    *   **Challenge:** Refactoring the graph traversal and rendering logic to work with the new data structure.
9.  **Graph Data Validation:** Add checks to ensure graph data is valid (e.g., edges don't connect non-existent nodes).
    *   **Challenge:** Implementing robust validation without a significant performance penalty during graph loading.
10. **Floating-Point Coordinates:** Use `float` or `double` for node coordinates to support more precise layout algorithms.
    *   **Challenge:** All floating-point coordinates must be correctly quantized or rounded for rendering on the integer-based console grid.
11. **Node Shape Primitives:** Allow nodes to be rendered as primitive shapes other than squares (e.g., circles, diamonds, triangles).
    *   **Challenge:** Drawing smooth-looking primitive shapes with ASCII characters is difficult.
12. **Graph Deep Copy:** Implement a proper deep copy constructor for the `Graph` class to support state saving for animations.
    *   **Challenge:** Ensuring all dynamically allocated memory is correctly copied without memory leaks.
13. **Spatial Hashing:** Implement a spatial hash or quadtree to speed up rendering and collision detection for very large graphs.
    *   **Challenge:** Adds significant complexity to the data structures; overkill for small graphs.
14. **Node/Edge Metadata:** Allow arbitrary key-value metadata on nodes and edges for use by advanced rendering techniques.
    *   **Challenge:** Designing a flexible data structure for metadata that is still efficient to access.
15. **Object-Oriented Nodes/Edges:** Convert `Node` and `Edge` structs into classes with methods to encapsulate their logic.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires a significant architectural refactor, moving logic from the `GraphRenderer` into these new classes.

18. **Force-Directed Layout:** Implement an algorithm like Fruchterman-Reingold to automatically position nodes based on forces.
    *   **Challenge:** These algorithms are computationally intensive and require many iterations to reach a stable, visually pleasing state.
19. **Hierarchical Layout:** Implement a layout algorithm for tree-like graphs (e.g., Reingold-Tilford).
    *   **Challenge:** Requires first identifying the hierarchy and is unsuitable for non-hierarchical graphs.
20. **Concentric Circle Layout:** Place nodes in concentric circles based on a metric like distance from a central node.
    *   **Challenge:** Can become cluttered if many nodes share the same metric value.
21. **Matrix Layout:** Display the graph's adjacency matrix using ASCII characters to represent connections.

    *   **Challenge:** Can be slow and may disrupt the initial layout's structure.
29. **Edge Rerouting:** Implement an algorithm to reroute edge paths to minimize crossings.
    *   **Challenge:** Computationally very expensive (NP-hard in the general case).
30. **Graph Slicing:** Only show a 2D "slice" of the 3D graph at a time, allowing the user to step through the slices.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires a mechanism to control the slicing and display the current slice index.
31. **Automated "Beauty Shot" Camera:** Implement logic to automatically find the "best" angle to view the current graph from.

35. **Graph Morphing Animation:** Animate the transformation of one graph structure into another.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires solving the graph isomorphism problem (or a heuristic) to map nodes between the two graphs.

    *   **Challenge:** Merging the graph and background without visual conflicts.
49. **"Blueprint" Render Style:** Render the graph with a blueprint-like aesthetic (e.g., using `.` for grid and `+` for outlines).
    *   **Challenge:** Designing a full character set and style that is visually consistent.
